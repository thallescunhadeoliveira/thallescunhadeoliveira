# 👋 Hi! I'm Thalles

I hold a degree in **Psychology from UFSCar** and a degree in **Database Management from Estácio**. Since 2022, I've been working as a **Data Analyst at Azos**, where I focus on automation, data visualization, and supporting decision-making through data insights.

Currently, I'm expanding my expertise into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, aiming to transition into Data Science and apply advanced statistical and computational techniques to solve real-world business problems.
